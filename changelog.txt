- modules and plugins have now the method ->config() to get own config item, second argument is default value (standard NULL)
- if a form in FlexyAdmin has changed and not saved and the browser leaves the page: a warning will popup to prevent lost changes
- Admin UI names and help can be in more languages now (see cfg_ui), standard englisch and nederlands.
- Forms can have tabs (which reflects fieldsets). You can add fieldsets per table at cfg_table_info, and set per field in which fieldset it sits at cfg_field_info (no fieldsets means the standard fieldset)
	- Where to use?:
		- With mult-language sites: put every language under a tab
		- With tables with lots of fields (and options): put the extra's under another tab, or group them logically with tabs.
- some performance ...
- you can set FORM_NICE_DROPDOWNS in flexyadmin_config to FALSE if the nice dropdowns has performance issues (if there are realy a lot of options), this will fall back to standard dropdown fields
- remove the class fields from tinyMCE links popup (is realy not needed since you can use the styles dropdown): if you need it, set in on in site/assets/css/admin.css
- My_text_helper: added function highlight_code_if_needed()
- db->get_field_where() can search also with LIKE instead of a normal WHERE = statement
BUGS:
- some bugs in the plugin_handler
- some bugs in plugin_automenu
- some styling bugs
- bug in form with password fields
