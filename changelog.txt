	- all str_ui_name and txt_help fields from cfg_table_info, cfg_field_info and cfg_media_info are moved to a new table: cfg_ui
	- removed cfg_table_info.b_single_row, just set int_max_rows to 1 for same result.
	
NEW:
- controller is changed: no need to change code for standard options: just set the options in config (see the userguide)
- change the variable name $item to $page (in controller and all standard modules): just for easthetics and reflecting more what it is
- new standard modules:
	- submenu
	- login and its views (for authentication in frontend sites, uses the ion_auth/user class)

		- With mult-language sites: put every language under a tab
		- With tables with lots of fields (and options): put the extra's under another tab, or group them logically with tabs.
- some performance ...
- you can set FORM_NICE_DROPDOWNS in flexyadmin_config to FALSE if the nice dropdowns has performance issues (if there are realy a lot of options), this will fall back to standard dropdown fields
- remove the class fields from tinyMCE links popup (is realy not needed since you can use the styles dropdown): if you need it, set in on in site/assets/css/admin.css
