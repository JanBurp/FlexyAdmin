NEW:
====

- site statistics:
	- needs table log_stats and map site/stats
	
- Flexible Admin menu:
	- needs a new table: cfg_admin_menu
	- You can create you're own admin menu in a flexible way now. Even double tables with where statements
	
- Drag 'N Drop ordering of images and multiple selections:
	- field medias_ : you can change the order of images by drag 'n drop
	- field media_  : default is a dropdown with filenames, but you can choose to do it with a drag 'n drop (images), select it in cfg_media_info (b_dragndrop)
	- rel_tabes			: default is a dropdown with multiple selections, but now you can choose to drag 'n drop between lists and order the items, select it in cfg_table_info (form_many_type, ordered_list)

- Restyling of tinyMCE
- Slimming down the styling: removed unused icons and move the originals outside
