/******** FlexyAdmin changes *******************/

- Remove all PHP4 ugliness
- cfg: minumum password length: 4 (for standard passwords admin & user)
- cfg: empty meta table and meta colums (we don't need this)
- cfg: change 'groups' to 'cfg_user_groups'
- cfg: change 'users' to 'cfg_users'
- model: change databasefield names according to flexyadmin names
- model->get_users: only join meta data if meta table/columns are set
- renamed controller to auth_controller - we don't use this
- there is a new library: user, which extends the ion_auth library

Changes to ion_auth_model and user table so it works like tables in flexyadmin:

Table 'users' => 'cfg_users':
- username => str_username
- password => gpw_password
- email => email_email
- group_id => id_user_group
- active => b_active
- salt => str_salt
- activation_code => str_activation_code
- forgotten_password_code => str_forgotten_password_code
- remember_code => str_remember_code
+ str_language
+ str_filemanager_view

Table 'groups' => 'cfg_user_groups':
- name => str_name
- description => str_description

Table 'meta' => REMOVED (We don't need it)
