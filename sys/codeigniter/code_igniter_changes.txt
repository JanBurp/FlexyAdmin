Method				my_view()
Description		http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/73545/
Same as the view() method: loads a view. But with this one you can give the path of the view, which makes it possible to load a view outside the standard directory structure.

File					sys\codeigniter\libraries\Loader.php
Line					1162-1164
Method				site_view()
Description		http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/73545/
Calls my_view() with path: site/views/. So this is a standard view method for loading views for the frontend sites of FlexyAdmin.

Line					1166-1200
Method				site_plugin($plugins,$path)

Load a plugin from given path. Makes it possible to load plugins from site/plugins.
